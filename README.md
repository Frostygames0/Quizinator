# Quizinator

So.... at school, we started working with presentations and we were given a task to create a 'quiz'. 
I decided to go ahead and write a whole program for creating quizzes! 
At the same time I will learn how to work with Avalonia and WPF similar things, MVVM and reactive programming!

It's not perfect, as this my first time working with any GUI library.
So excuse me, if I'm doing something wrong!
